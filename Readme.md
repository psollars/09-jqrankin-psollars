# Finding Sustainable Development

## Patrick Sollars and Jacob Rankin

**SIADS 593 | October 2022**

### Motivation

Economic development and quality of life are major factors that must be accounted for by leadership of the world's nations. Collectively, we must all face the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions produced as a byproduct of moving economies, contributing to global warming and climate change.

Studies indicate that the rapid development of China’s economy was supported by the use of traditional fossil fuel energy sources that are harmful to the environment. However, in the case of the USA, there is strong evidence that some economic factors including economic growth, labor force, and capital could reduce emissions. (Yamaka et al., 2021)

We’re hoping to discover how developing nations are weighing these tradeoffs between rapid economic expansion and damaging emissions. Could there be other examples of countries like the USA, which are mature enough to grow their economies sustainably? Understanding how economic factors contribute to climate change may shed light on how progress is made toward sustainable development goals.

Additionally, economic development is a driver for reductions in poverty. (Britz et al., 2022) We want to analyze the correlations between countries with increasing GDP and decreasing poverty in an attempt to gain insight into whether this is having a negative impact on the environment or if some countries are finding ways to develop in a sustainable manner.

We will collect data on **Greenhouse Gas Emissions** (CO2, CH4, N2O, etc.) for each country and compare it to the country's **Gross Domestic Product** (as a measure of economic output) and **Poverty Rate** (as a measure of quality of life outcomes).

### Objectives

- How does a country's economic standing contribute to its greenhouse gas output?
- Can we identify countries with relatively high standards of living that also have minimal impact on the environment?
- Are developing countries increasing emissions (and increasing GDP?) as their population lifts out of poverty?
